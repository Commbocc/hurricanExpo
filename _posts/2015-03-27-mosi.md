For a family outing, head on over to MOSI to experience Disasterville featuring WeatherQuest, a 10,000-square-foot exhibition on floods, hail, lightning, tsunamis and volcanoes, including immersion theatres that demonstrate what it's like to be in an earthquake, hurricane, tornado and wildfire. Sometimes the visual impact this exhibit has can strengthen and reinforce the messages learned from the City and County emergency management sites.
