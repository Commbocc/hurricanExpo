Join us for the largest hurricane preparedness expo in Florida on {{ site.event_date | date: "%A %B %-d, %Y" }} from {{ site.event_date | date: "%r" }} to {{ site.end_date | date: "%r" }} at the Museum of Science and Industry. The Expo is an educational event for the entire family. You will enjoy plenty of activities for adults and children, exhibits and much more!

This year's theme, Be Ready Tampa Bay, will focus on the importance of taking actions before a major disaster to ensure you can recover successfully and thrive after a storm.

While our local emergency responders are ready for any disaster we face, they still look to you, our residents, to <a href="{{ "/sponsor" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">help</a>. 

In addition to guest speakers, the event will feature safety demonstrations, emergency vehicle displays, educational exhibits, and vendors of safety products, personal disaster preparedness and home retrofit products.
