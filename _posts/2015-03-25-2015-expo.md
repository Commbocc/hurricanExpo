The Tampa Bay Hurricane Expo is a free, entertaining and informative event for the entire community. There will be dozens of vendors on display, representing private companies and government agencies, to take the mystery out of storm season preparation and make the homework for family disaster planning a little easier.

Panel presentations throughout the day will feature meteorologists from local news stations and the National Weather Service, local emergency management officials, and experts in various other disaster response fields. Bring your questions and be prepared to take home a wealth of information about what you can do to prepare you, your family and your home.  

While youâ€™re here, plan to spend the day and visit MOSI. Experience Disasterville featuring WeatherQuest, a 10,000-square-foot exhibition on floods, hail, lightning, tsunamis and volcanoes, including immersion theatres that demonstrate what it's like to be in an earthquake, hurricane, tornado and wildfire. The museum is open to 6 p.m. on Saturday.
