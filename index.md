The event will consist of various partners within Hillsborough County from a variety of agencies and organizations. These partners will have different booths and provide materials explaining how they support emergency/disaster response and recovery operations. It will include activities for adults and children, educational displays, meteorology panel and tips from the experts. Mall goers will be able to identify their evacuation zone, pick up disaster preparedness materials, get different giveaways and enter a raffle to win a grand prize.

This year's theme- Partners In Preparedness will focus on the importance of the whole community (those most at risk for a known hazard, children, older adults, people with disabilities, non- English speakers, vulnerable populations, emergency managers, first responders, businesses, community groups, schools etc.) working together to be better prepared for major emergencies or disasters.
